# MuscleBoy
## What does this application do:
This is a workout tracking application with the following important features:
* Based on selection of muscle group (from a body diagram), the relevant excerciese are suggested.
* Depending on your input to the excercise selected (the repetitions and the weights), the muscle group gets shaded darker accordingly 
* You have a log of your past workouts

We did not have all of the features listed above. We had a core application where in:
 * a user can select the muscle group
 * a deafult file of the excercises matching a muscle group
